I used code generated by Brace to help me complete some of Step 12. 
Brace Generated Code (modified by me to fit into the script):

        const textMetric = ctx.measureText(this.sticker);
        const textWidth = textMetric.width;
        const textHeight = textMetric.actualBoundingBoxAscent - textMetric.actualBoundingBoxDescent;
        ctx.fillText(this.sticker, -textWidth/2, -textHeight/2);

I could not figure out how to rotate a sticker while keeping it somewhat centered around the cursor so I asked Brace for help and it did not fail me. This code is used twice: once for previewing the sticker, and once for actually placing the sticker down.
